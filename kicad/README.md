# KiCAD Files for spooky-button-board
The KiCAD schematic and PCB files and other related files can be found here.

The PCB layout was designed with the intention to have it manufactured by
[JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/) and therefore uses constraints (trace width, via
diameter, etc.) within
[their capabilities](https://jlcpcb.com/capabilities/Capabilities).
